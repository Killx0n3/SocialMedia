## Project Details
SimpleSocial is a new, exciting, messaging service like nothing you've seen before!
SimpleSocial is a micro-blogging service that allows users to post short messages of 150 characters or less.  All messages are public but a user can follow any other user and get their SimpleSocial included in their home pages.  Each user has a page that lists only their own SimpleSocial, there is also a page that lists mentions of a user (@ + username).

## Framework
Python Bottle Framework is used to make this prroject.

## Change-log
- I have made a better skin (css) for the site, yet to upload.
